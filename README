README file -- color statistics project

=== Getting started ===

1. 
2. Run 'setPath'.
3. Run 'demoColorCompatibility'


=== Utils ===

Don't forget to download the "utils" code, available online at:

https://github.com/jflalonde/utils

=== Image database ===

Right now, the image database is accessible through the webserver:
http://balaton.graphics.cs.cmu.edu/jlalonde/colorStatistics/Images

If you are interested in obtaining the image database (it's basically a scaled-down
version of a subset of LabelMe), send me an email and I'll put a .zip file
online for you to download).

=== Recoloring ===

The recoloring code is very slow because of Matlab's kmeans function. Feel 
free to replace with your own, faster version.
