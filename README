README file -- color statistics project

=== Getting started ===

1. 
2. Run 'setPath'.
3. Run 'demoColorCompatibility'


=== Utils ===

Don't forget to download the "utils" code, available at:

https://github.com/jflalonde/utils

Also, the re-coloring code requires VLFeat, available at: 

http://www.vlfeat.org/

Version 0.9.14 was used to test this code. 


=== Image database ===

Right now, the image database is accessible through the webserver:
http://balaton.graphics.cs.cmu.edu/jlalonde/colorStatistics/Images

If you are interested in obtaining the image database (it's basically a scaled-down
version of a subset of LabelMe), send me an email and I'll put a .zip file
online for you to download).
